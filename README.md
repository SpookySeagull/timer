# Timer
Small timer for using Pomidoro when I study

## DO NOT USE IT
It's totally useless, for exemple it uses .mp3 sound, that I obviosly can't upload on GitHub.
And I'm to lazy to build it so anybody can use their own sounds.
In the end, it's just a little study project.

## TODOs

- [x] Make a test timer
- [x] Make a test with command-line arguments
- [x] Make exeption for no arguments
- [x] Get it to make sound
- [x] Make it all work together
- [x] Spread positivity in the world :)
